# Notes
Tutorial created by SpinnySpiwal (Discord)
Device I use: iPhone 13 (A2633)
iOS Version: iOS 16.6b1 (20G5026e)
Why did I create this? I wanted Semi-Jailbreaking to be more accessible to the community.

# Compatibility
Serotonin does not support iOS 17.0, you need to meet the requirements:
* **On a KFD-Supported iOS Version >iOS 16.7**
* TrollStore 2 Installed (**Highly** Recommended)

## Why Bootstrap Beta 3.1?
Bootstrap Beta 3.1 is the most stable version of bootstrap I have used so far.

# How do I semi jailbreak?
1. Download Bootstrap Beta 3.1 from [Here.](#bootstrap)

2. Download Serotonin (Latest) from [Here.](#serotonin)

4. Open Bootstrap Beta 3.1.

5. Tap "Install" or "Bootstrap"

6. If you're installing, it will ask for a sudo password. The field can't be blank. If you already installed, skip this step.

7. Wait for the device to respring.

8. Now unlock your iDevice and open Serotonin.

9. Tap "Jailbreak"

10. Wait for the button to change to "Userspace Reboot".

11. If the app crashes or your phone restarts, go back to step 3.

12. Tap "Userspace Reboot".

13. If all goes well, your device may say "Confidential & Proprietary, Call ..." at the bottom of your iDevice's screen. If it does not, and you don't have a tweak to hide that installed, try again from step 8. If it restarts during that, go back to step 3.

# Congratulations
Congratulations, you have successfully semi jailbroken your iDevice!
