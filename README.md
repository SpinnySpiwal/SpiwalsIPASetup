# SpiwalsIPASetup
I am on an iPhone 13 using iOS 16.6 beta one.

I use TrollStore 2 to install apps.
I use Enmity to use plugins with Discord & to use deprecated features of Tabs V2 like the amazing server list.
I use AppsDump 2 (Cracked) to dump the decrypted IPAs of apps.
I have flappy bird for if and when I get bored.
I have Filza (Cracked) to change plists without KFD tweaks.
I use yYouPlus by qnBlackCat to avoid sponsors and see dislikes. It also has s way to hide the YT Shorts tab.
